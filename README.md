# Donation Management Application
*Fundamental to a non-profit organization*

### Project Inspiration:
Back in high school, I volunteered at an organization called **Richmond Multicultural Community Service**, which serves
to provide support to new immigrants. Some instances of the services that we provided are English lessons, job fairs,
and tax clinics. The organization constantly receives funding and donations, so it needs a method of tracking them. When 
I was volunteering, I helped them create a spreadsheet with JavaScript customization. Now, looking back, I have acquired 
way more programming experience and knowledge in object-oriented design. Therefore, I want to help them **upgrade** the 
donation tracking method from a **spreadsheet** to a **Java desktop application**!

### Project Description:
The goal of the project is to help the **executive assistant** at RMCS keep a reliable record of all the donations 
received. Some targets that this application should achieve includes:
- Showing the total amount of donations received. 
- Keeping track of the donors' information, along with details of the transactions, such as amount and transaction type. 
- Being able to quickly find a donor by name, or create a report of the donors that have donated over a certain amount. 
- Handling a large amount of data; therefore, an area of improvement is to connect to SQL data using the JDBC library. 
- Ensuring security, protected by username and password.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to add a new donor record to the existing list of donors. 
- As a user, I want to add a new transaction to the list of transactions for a specific donor. 
- As a user, I want to search for a donor by name and view all the details of their donation transactions. 
- As a user, I want to view a list of donors who donated over a specified amount. 
- As a user, I want the login page to be protected by a username and password.
- As a user, I want the ability to mark transactions as archived after the current year ends, ensuring that they cannot be altered or changed. 
- As a user, I want the capability to back up my data locally, providing ways to retrieve information in case of an accident.
